Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? What's that ? Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts .

Ma Yes , I'm from Taiwan . Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular.But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh.Chinese is no problem for Apple . Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends.But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple . Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help .

I don ’ t think I can take another semester of this dorm food . I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired .

You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ? You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school .

I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as I usually do . Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know . Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch . And what about dinner ? Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all . That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ? I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first .
Hello , Sir , may I help you ? Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways !

All I want is for you to do your best in everything you do .

Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty . How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same . The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes . I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ? Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal .

We ’ d better have breakfast now . and meet him later .

I guess you get what you pay for . How long did you stay there ? Just one night , when my flight was canceled due to bad weather .

Well , Tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work , easier set them done . But working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup .
Mr . Tang , we have decided to hire you . How much do you expect to get a month ? I'm making three thousand yuan a month at my present work . I should not , of course , make a change for less . Could you provide me with a monthly salary of four thousand yuan ? I don ’ t think we can give you that much as the starting salary . You know , Mr . Allen , Nowadays this starting salary is not high based on my skills and experience . Maybe , but there are many fringe benefits here . ' ' What are they ? Additional to medical benefits , we also offer a rent free house and the use of a car . But I have my own car and my own house . ' ' OK , 4000 yuan a month . Thank you very much . ' " Not at all , it's reasonable .

Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime .

Mr . Smith , I would like to get right to the point here . First , we need to talk about how much each company will pay . Well , we want to have the largest share . Our company is much larger than yours , and we have been in business longer . Let's look at that another way . The major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger . What are you thinking about ? We do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position . We are a good , small company---that's why you are interested . Then , what would make you feel more comfortable ? If you take a 75 % position in the venture , we would take a back seat to you .

As an experienced interviewer , could you tell me what kind of behavior the interviewer hates most ? Rudeness . You are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage . And we should have good sitting posture .

Have we met ? ' " I don't think so . Michael . Hello , Michael . My name's Shirley . Pleased to meet you . Pleased to meet you , too , Shirley . So , what do you do ? I work in marketing . I'm a regional marketing manager for an IT company . Normally , I work out of Beijing , but I'm here on business . My friend Judy over there , she lives here and she invited me to this party . And you ? How about you ? I live here . I was invited by George-he's the tall guy over there . He looks a bit drunk , actually ...
I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . That is just an excuse.You can always find some time to exercise . But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing.And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . I know you're right , but what can I do ? How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? But I'll miss the news.It ' s important in my business to keep up with events in China . I know , I know.Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . That's a good idea !
Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it . Why ? Just read your notes.You can see what the professor stressed in the lectures.Probably the exam will ask about things he stressed . Yes , but my notes are all nonsense . I can't figure out what is important . Let me see them.Are these all the notes you have ? ' ' Yes . But Laurie , how can you do well in school if you don't take more notes ? What do you mean ? You think I don't write enough . I'm sure you don't write enough.Look at this . Here you wrote , Russian Revolution . 1917 . Bolsheviks . Real revolution , or coup ? And that's all ? I remember he lectured for a half hour about that question.And you didn't write any of it ! I know , but I listened . Yes , but did you remember ? You need good notes to help you remember . I suppose you're right . But what can I do ? I don't know what to write down . There are different things you can do.For one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking.You should go to the course . Also , I am pretty good at taking notes . I can help you on this exam . I will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes.Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down . That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot . Don't feel that way . I know you are very smart.Note - taking is a special skill . All students need to learn it.Some people are very smart , but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet . I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school.She taught me how to take good notes . It's not hard . Alright . University and high school seem very different to me . I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes . Then I will do better .

In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf . I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played . A great deal of people follow rugby in my country . There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too .

I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ? He appeals to the fans thanks to two things You mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time . In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . Yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . And he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent .

There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested .

Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ? Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep . Didn't you bring his favorite toy ? Yes , we did . Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms . Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan . My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks , so we compromised and finally went to the seaside . I think vacation in summer is not good . You must have had a great time . Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming . Yes , he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten . His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir . And I taught him how to swim in the sea . It was fun and made him braver than before . After we returned home , he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom .
This is the house I want to rent . Could you tell me the advantages of it ? No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? 200 dollars per week . In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . It certainly is .

Ok , I will think about it .

You ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ? It ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ? I ’ d like to get away from the big city life . Maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing . I heard they are very relaxing . I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t so far away . Since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number . Thanks , I ’ ll give them a call later .

Sir , I am very glad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product . It is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies . We are beginning to get more attention from overseas . Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ? OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products . That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising . Yes , the mass media has wider influence . One of my classmates works in an advertisement company . I can get help and inspiration from him . And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . Personally , I prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider .

When is your birthday ? It is December 25th . Wow ! What a lucky girl ! Your birthday is on Christmas Day . Yes , I am lucky . I was born on Christ ’ s birthday . Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays . When is your birthday ? April 2nd . I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day . I guess I am lucky , too ! That is true !

What do you like to do in your spare time ? I am a girl of many interests . I like dance , chess , collecting stamps , travelling and taking photos . What kind of dance do you like ? ' ' I like rumba and tango . Great . I am not interested in Chinese chess . It is too difficult for me . You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess . Both of them are much easier . OK , I will try . As for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ? Yes , it is . But it is full of fun and knowledge . What about you , what do you like to do as hobby ? I like gardening . I take care of them everyday . I like those flowers and the swing in my garden . If the weather is nice , I would like to lie on the lawn . Sounds pleasant .

David , what do you want to do after graduation ? I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account . It beats me ! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing . You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor , and then make a decision .
I have been getting headaches almost every day lately . Have you just started getting a lot of headaches ? I never had very many headaches before , but the last few weeks I have been getting a lot of them . Have you had any unusually stressful situations in your life lately ?

Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air . She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ? Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things . They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ? Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it . That's right . You have learned a lot , haven't you ?

I think I found my Yankee's mug ... " ' Oh , great . Where was it ? It fell out of the garbage bag . ' ' What was it doing there ? It was with all the other dishes from dinner . You mean Johnny threw out all the dinnerware ? I think our son was trying to pull a fast one on us .

Print shop . Seam speaking . Hi , Sean . It ’ s Mary in Mr . Emory ’ s office . I placed an order for 1,000 bound copies of a staff manual last week . It usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete a job like that . Well , I was hoping you would do me a big favor . That was supposed to be a rush order , I forgot to tell you . I ’ m getting a lot of flak from my boss .
I've just been a little depressed lately . " " What's wrong ? Nothing really . ' ' Then just keep your chin up .

Lousy weather , isn't it ? It has stopped snowing , but it's even colder . Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves . And the streets are covered with snow . Do you know what the temperature is today ? I missed today's weather forecast over the TV . It feels like ten degrees below zero at least .

Let's go skating together tomorrow .

I could be happy just staying home , you know . Okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing . Do you feel like dancing ? ' ' Yes ? Why not ? Alright.At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends . They aren't alcoholic ! No , maybe they're not . But they're close . So where should we go ? Let's go to the Latin Club . I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend . Maybe it's Friday night . You always want to go to the Latin Club . I don't know those dance steps . I'd rather go to the New Bar . The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night.You really want to dance to that ? It's not all techno music . It's not a special techno night . No . But they play techno all the time . It drives me crazy after forty minutes.And anyhow , if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance steps.At the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour.And then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . I know you . It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club . I like Latin Music.The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock.What was that bar called ? Oh . You mean Jerry's , over on the east side.That wasn't my idea going there . No . It was that friend of yours , Melissa.Her and all her lousy country music Cds . Yecch ! It's true . I would never go there again either.Country music is a nightmare . So is it the Latin Club ? Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do . Well , it seems you'll have to learn some Spanish too , won't you ? Maybe .
How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ? If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction . Exactly , I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , I guess . They were only three of us in the elevator , I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them . Well , I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry . Anyway , it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others , especially strangers . Sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way .
Excuse me , are you Miss Green ? ' ' Yes . May I help you ? May I introduce myself ? ' ' Yes . I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John . Nice to meet you , John . It ’ s a pleasure to meet you , Miss Green .

Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review . My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson . Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . You have always been so soft , Dave ! Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out . Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave !
I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . And what did the program say ? It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier . I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea . And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day .
Who's singing in your home , Jim ? " " It's Ellie and her friends . Who's Ellie ? She\'s my little niece.It \' s her birthday.They \' re singing " Happy Birthday " . Oh , I see.how old is she ? ' " She's ten . I suppose they're playing games . Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , when's your birthday ? Today . ' ' Today ? ' ' Yes . Well , imagine that ! How old are you ? Eighteen.Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight.Do you want to come ? Very much.What time ? ' ' About 6 . I'll be at your house at about five thirty.Happy birthday .
My goodness ! You ’ re kidding ! No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job . That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities . Come on ! Don ’ t be silly ! Your present job is something better . Why do you change ? Well . How do you know ?
Shall I punch out for you , Ross ? I am leaving now . No , thanks . I have got to work overtime . But today is Friday . You are not going to work overtime on Friday evening , are you ? Well , I am . I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting . Is Tom coming to pick you up ? No . We ’ ll meet at my house . He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa . That's nice . Where is his villa ? It's not his villa , but his father's . I think it's somewhere in Florida . I am not sure myself . Sometimes I envy you a lot . Tom is a good guy . Come on . You just haven ’ t met the right person and I think that you work too much . You should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life . I know , but I am a work maniac . Well , suit yourself . I've got to run now . Have a nice weekend . You too . Oh , I forgot to tell you one thing . A girl called this afternoon . She said she was your ex-girlfriend . She wanted you to call her back . Did she mention anything else ? No , nothing else . See you Monday . ' ' See you .
What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price ? How do I handle that ? Well , these things happens , I know that . You just have to stay straight with me . Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ? Well , I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy , not you . Excuse me ? Yeah , it really is that simple.Every time there's a change in the items we do business on , you let me know . That's all you need to do . What kind of change , just in prices ? No , any change . I want you to keep me as informed as you are . I need to know as much as you do . If you hear about something that might happen , then tell me about it.Tell me it's rumor , what it's based on and your opinion on how likely it is . You mean on product availability , reliability and price ? No , everthing.Those things for sure , but also labor problems , raw materials , new subcontractors , mergers , in short , anything and everything.So I can make a fully informed decision . So it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . I can do that , provided the company I'm working for isn't hurt . I think we'll get along fine .
This is the house I want to rent . Could you tell me the advantages of it ? No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? 200 dollars per week . In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ? I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ? Twice a week for work and once for shopping . In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university . That's true . Ok , I will think about it .
Can we have two tickets for seven thirty ? Yes , and would you like to have seats in the front or at the back ? In the front , please . ' " That's 35 yuan each . Thank you . And what's on tomorrow ? " ' Tarzan . Can we get tickets now ? ' ' I am afraid not . Tomorrow is premiere .
Merry Christmas , Mr . Wang . I would like to give you the book I specially chose as my appreciation for your sincere help to me in the past few days . Thanks , Mr . White . That's very kind of you . I hope it will be of some use to you . I am sure it will . It'll be of great help in carrying on the work I have done so far . That will be great .
Pardon me . Does your hotel have a fitness facility ? Yes , sir . We try to anticipate all our guests ' needs , including fitness . Great ! Where is it ? Sir , the gym is just below the lobby . You can take the elevator or the stairs . Do I have to pay extra ? No , sir . It's gratis . Just take your room key so you can get in . What are the gym hours ? You'll be happy to know that it's open 24/7 . Great ! Is a trainer available ? I'm sorry , but no . We used to have a trainer , but then he had an unfortunate accident .
Speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic . Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . Sure . It's one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? Yes , I went to the New Year ’ s Concert in 2010 . Wow , you're so lucky . I saw it on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . That's for sure . You know , I had the greatest time ever .
People of different races are fit for quite different sports . For instance , Asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . They seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable . And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics , right ? Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving . Then what are the Westerners fit for ? I think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity , speed and explosive force like swimming , field games , etc . Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ? It's common sense that African athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon . I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes .
I want to leave home , mum . ' ' Why ? I am a grown-up , and I can stand on my own two feet . It is all up to you .
Hi , Bob ! How are you doing ? ' ' Fine ! How are you ? I'm fine too , thank you . I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening.Will you come with me ? I've two complimentary tickets . With the greatest pleasure.Where is the concert this evening ? It will be held at the Music Hall . ' " What's on the program ? It's a piano recital . I'm fond of piano , you know .
Thank you very much for your invitation . It's a great honor to have you here , Mr.Brown . I'd like to say goodbye to you . I look forward to seeing you soon.Goodbye !
Here you are at last ! You're half an hour late , you know . I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long . What happened ? My watch stopped and I didn't know . I certainly need to buy a better one .
I can't believe the way our landlord cheated us . I know how you feel . I had a similar problem with a landlord a few years ago . Fortunately , the one we have now is very nice .
Good morning , Sir . ' ' Morning . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ? Yes . You can take No . 846 from here , but you have to get off at Nanchengmen stop and change to No . 106 . That ’ s a little troublesome . Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take No . 105 which will let you right off in front of the zoo gate . Maybe that ’ s what I'll do . Thanks a lot . " ' You ’ re welcome .
What seems to be the problem ? Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed . What ? You've got to be kidding me ! I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week . Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner . Well , there is no problem there . But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused , and that your motives are personal and not professional . I think she's misinterpreted my intentions . What happens now ? Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown . It's quite serious . You could be reprimanded , or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring I understand that . But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction . That's the purpose of the meeting . Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out , and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters .
Hello , this is Li King . Can I talk to your manager ? Sorry , he has just gone out now . Can I take a message for you ? Yes . Would you please kindly tell him I want to apply for a proof-reader in your newspaper ? OK , I got it .
I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it . I hope so . Let me know how many will come . Then I will book the restaurant .
My friend Jane is very beautiful . ' " What's her figure ? Perfect . And I like her charming eyes , too . What's the color of her eyes ? " ' Dark blue . ' ' how old is she ? Twenty .
Who's that man over there talking to James ? Where ? Oh , that's Henry . He's very handsome , isn't he ? What's he like ? He's very nice , actually , but rather eccentric . Really ? I love eccentric people . Yes , but he may be too eccentric even for you . Why ? What do you mean by that ? ' " Well , haven't you heard ? Heard what ? No one ever tells me anything . Well , apparently , he's been having an affair with his secretary . Really ! How fascinating . According to Mary , he's divorcing his wife and there's a big fight going on about the children . I thought everyone knew . Well , what can I say ? I didn't know . Oh , I meant to tell you earlier , your blouse doesn't really match your skirt . Those colors don't really suit you either . Oh . Thanks . Look , I must just go and say hello to someone . I'll be right back .
Hi , Daniel , how are you holding up ? I am greatly sorry for your loss . Thank you , I ’ m doing much better . I ’ Ve begun organizing everything for the funeral . How ’ s that going ? It ’ s a lot harder than I imagined . There are many things that you have to to arrange . I booked a time and date with the funeral home , but I still have a lot of things to do . Have you bought a burial plot and a casket ? No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean . I see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . You are doing a great job . Thanks , it hasn ’ t been easy , but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters .
Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ? I don ’ t know . ' ' Please think it over . ' ' Oh , I see . Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it . It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend . ' ' Ur , you really let me down . Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory . No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . What day is it on earth ? ' ' It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding .
I hear Yolanda has been studying every night this week for the exam . That's good , but I think it's too late . She hasn't studied all semester , and I doubt she can catch up in one week .
So how long have you known Mary ? ' ' Only four days . Only four days ! That's so short , and you seem so crazy about her . I know . I can't help thinking about her . She's always on my mind .
Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? Yes . I am going for a hike around the Qinghai Lake . Oh , do you go hiking often ? I go as much as I can . I love hiking , because you can really get in touch with nature . It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? Sure . But it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a lion on my last hike . Wow . You must have been pretty far away from the city . Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . Well , bring him along to . We will have a great time this weekend . Thanks . I will ask him .
I couldn't look at you , and say you aren't beautiful ! You are pretending ! No , Miss Anna , you must let me say how lovely you are ! What's wrong with that ? It's wrong because---it isn't true . You know that everybody notices how beautiful you are , don't you ? Well , no-that is , I've heard Linda say they do , but ... Thank you . But please don't speak to me again . Oh , Miss Anna ! That's too hard ! I won't be here long .
He has a long head , I bet he will do well in his business . He does , he started five years ago and now ends up the richest among us . When we were students , he was no good in any subject . It seemed to be useless to study well when we were young if we examine his case .
Oh , the ink is spilled on the desk . Did it spill on your clothes ? No , but the table cloth was dirty . ' " That's OK . I'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain . It's no big deal . I really feel great shame . Let me buy a new one for you . Don't be silly , forget about it .
How often are stockholders meetings held ? Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year . What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ... You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . So , how much say do the stockholders really have ? Unless they're united , very little ...
What have you been up to , Johnny ? You know-sweeping , scrubbing , washing , drying , waxing , polishing ... Wow , your grandma's really having a field day with you , huh ? You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes . You have all the fun , don't you ? Listen , I'd better get back to the grindstone . Sure thing , Johnny .

I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment . What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ? He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ... You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him .

There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . The city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs . I like it . It makes the city feel alive . I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans . I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more . I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . I don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying . I really hate receiving spam . I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway . Yes , that annoys me too . With billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign . I like that too . I don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something . That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products . They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty .

Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .
